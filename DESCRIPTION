Description: HTML tables are a valuable data source but extracting and recasting
    these data into a useful format can be tedious. htmltab is a package for
    extracting structured information from HTML tables. It is similar to
    readHTMLTable() of the XML package but provides two major advantages. First,
    the function automatically expands row and column spans in the header and
    body cells. Second, users are given more control over the identification of
    header and body rows which will end up in the R table. Additionally, the
    function preprocesses table code, removes unneeded parts and so helps to
    alleviate the need for tedious post-processing.
