Description: HTML tables are a valuable data source but extracting and recasting
    these data into a useful format can be tedious. This package allows to collect
    structured information from HTML tables. It is similar to `readHTMLTable()`
    of the XML package but provides three major advantages. First, the function
    automatically expands row and column spans in the header and body cells.
    Second, users are given more control over the identification of header and body
    rows which will end up in the R table, including semantic header information
    that appear throughout the body. Third, the function preprocesses table code,
    corrects common types of malformations, removes unneeded parts and so helps to
    alleviate the need for tedious post-processing.
