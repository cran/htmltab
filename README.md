HTML tables are a valuable data source but extracting and recasting
these data into a useful format can be tedious. htmltab is a package for
extracting structured information from HTML tables. It is similar to
`readHTMLTable()` of the XML package but provides two major advantages:

1.  First, the function automatically expands row and column spans in
    the header and body cells.
2.  Second, users are given more control over the identification of
    header and body rows which will end up in the R table.

Additionally, the function preprocesses table code, removes unneeded
parts and so helps to alleviate the need for tedious post-processing.

## Installation

You can install the released version of htmltab from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("htmltab")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("htmltab/htmltab")
```

## Usage
